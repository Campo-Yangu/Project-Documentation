CampoYangu Project Documentation
Welcome to CampoYangu, an open-source platform for technical campus students in Kenya. Our goal is to provide a collaborative space for students and tech enthusiasts to share ideas, exchange knowledge, and work together on various projects. This documentation provides guidelines on project management and how to contribute to the project.

Project Management Guidelines
Communication
Communication is essential to the success of the project. We use Slack for real-time communication and GitHub issues for tracking tasks, bugs, and feature requests. All project participants are expected to be respectful and professional in their communication.

Task Assignment
As the project admin, you can assign tasks to contributors by creating an issue in the GitHub repository. The issue should include a clear description of the task, its requirements, and any relevant resources. Contributors are responsible for completing their assigned tasks and keeping the project admin updated on their progress.

Code Review
All code contributions to the project should go through a review process to ensure that they meet the project's quality standards. The project admin is responsible for reviewing and merging pull requests. Code review helps maintain code quality, identify potential issues, and ensure that the project meets its goals.

Project Milestones
We use GitHub's milestone feature to track project progress and set deadlines. Project milestones help us stay on track and ensure that we deliver on time. As the project admin, you are responsible for setting project milestones and updating them as needed.

Contributor's Guide
Fork the Repository
To contribute to the CampoYangu project, fork the repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.

Create a Branch
Create a new branch for your contribution, which should be based on the current development branch.

Code Contribution
Write your code, ensuring that it meets the project's standards and guidelines. Make sure to include clear documentation and comments where necessary.

Submit a Pull Request
Once you have completed your contribution, submit a pull request to the project's development branch. Your pull request will be reviewed by the project admin and other contributors.

Code Review
Your pull request will go through a review process where the project admin and other contributors will review your code and provide feedback. You may need to make changes to your code based on this feedback.

Merge and Release
Once your pull request has been approved, the project admin will merge it into the development branch. The changes will then be released in the next version of the platform.

Conclusion
Thank you for considering contributing to the CampoYangu project. We hope this documentation has been helpful in guiding you on how to contribute to the project. Remember, communication, task assignment, code review, and project milestones are critical to the success of this project. If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to the project admin.
